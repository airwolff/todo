[] Each Task should have an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'. [] When a Task is complete, its visual should change. The complete option should be 'checked off'. Each of these are accomplished in CSS, but will need to hook into logic to know whether or not the task is complete. Whether or not a Task is complete should also be stored in the database. Deleting a Task should remove it both from the front end as well as the Database.
